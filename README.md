## About the Project

The **Mansi Memes** repository is a collection of memes created in the Mansi language. These memes serve multiple purposes:

- **Cultural Preservation**: By using the Mansi language, we aim to keep the culture alive.
- **Education**: Memes can help learners engage with the language in a fun way.
- **Community Building**: Sharing memes fosters a sense of belonging among Mansi speakers and learners.

The project includes a variety of meme templates and examples that anyone can use. Feel free to create your own and share them with the community!

## Why Mansi?

The Mansi language is part of the Uralic language family, spoken by a small number of people in Russia. It is classified as a minority language, and its speakers face many challenges in preserving their linguistic heritage. By promoting the Mansi language through memes, we aim to raise awareness and encourage more people to learn and use it.

- **Cultural Preservation**: Keeping traditions alive through modern mediums.
